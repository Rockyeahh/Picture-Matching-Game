{
    //public float[] coins = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};   // 8 coins. 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50, £1, £2. Why a float? Should it be an array of game objects or something else?
    // Maybe this should just be in the CoinDisplay and refactored out once I know that it works.
    // Also the coin worth may need to be done seperately like a genereic script but with public ScoreWorth that can be adjusted in the ediitor depending on what I want.

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
